# Edit to script before execution.
1-> Change "data_path" variable in create_load_tables.py, opt_with_feed.py and opt_without_feed.py
    to reflect your absolute system path to hw_05/app folder.

# Execution process:
python create_load_tables.py  # create and load data.
python opt_with_feed.py       # Run optimization with feedcost.
python opt_without_feed.py    # Run optimization with out feedcost.

# OUTPUTS
results table in hw_05.db.

# With feed result in hw_05.db query.
select * from results where SENARIO='FEED';

# With no feed result in hw_05.db query.
select * from results where SENARIO='NO FEED';


# ANALYSIS:
select SCENARIO, sum(COWCOUNT) from results group by SCENARIO;

with feed cost we need less number of cows FEED|15201.0
With out feed cost we need more number of cows NO FEED|27712.0
