#### DESCRIPTION
Probeing decision variables. When decision variables are in large numbers there will be cases where for a given constrain few decision variables doesn't change. Setting those variables to a constant save lot of compute time.
This homework focues on finding such kind of variables and setting them to 1 and droping those analysis from analysis.

#### LEARNING
You will learn the following in this homework. 

* Decision variable reduction using probe technique.
* Python.
* Focuses more on programming logic.
